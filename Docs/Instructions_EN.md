## ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Instruction for using the RHI API - Tools plugin in English:

This plugin contains 9 different nodes, which you can see in the screenshot below:

</p>

This plugin was developed and tested exclusively for Unreal Engine 5.4

These nodes allow players to switch between DirectX 11, DirectX 12, or Vulkan directly from the game. The plugin saves the selected launch parameter in a text config and also allows using a secondary executable acting as a launcher â€” it has the suffix "*_Launcher.exe" and the same icon you see in the plugin section or on the main page of this repository.

If you want to change the icon of the .exe that serves as a launcher, you can use third-party programs for such tasks.

If you have purchased the plugin and want to connect it to your project:

In the plugin folder under `Resources`, you will find files such as:

- `RHI_API_Tools_Launcher.exe`
- `launch_parameter.txt`

Note that `launch_parameter.txt` may not be present initially, and thatâ€™s completely fine â€” it only stores the launch parameter like (-dx11, -dx12, -vulkan).

So if you want to specify the launch parameter in advance, you can either copy this file from `Resources` or create it yourself and write the desired launch parameter in it.

If your game is packaged in Shipping mode, you must place these files next to the gameâ€™s main .exe file, in the root folder of the game. Only then will the plugin work correctly.

### Plugin Structure

<p align="center">
  <img src="../Images/RHI_API_Tools_PLUGIN_CONTENT.png" width="512"/> 
</p>

1. Inside the plugin you will find a `Content` folder that includes:
   - A map where you can run a debug interface
   - A UI widget that clearly shows all plugin features

<p align="center">
  <img src="../Images/RHI_API_Tools__INSIDE_CONTENT.png" width="512"/> 
</p>

These files are accessible directly from the Unreal Engine 5.4 editor through the plugin folder. You may also copy or move them to your own project if desired.

2. The interface itself is quite simple and demonstrates each function of the plugin:

</p>

3. Inside the widget, there is not only the main logic for the interface and plugin functions, but also a separate Event Graph where all the plugin nodes are placed:
